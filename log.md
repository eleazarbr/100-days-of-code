**Today's Progress**:
D4 - Today I used the coding time to read about Heroku and DigitalOcean (need a place for side projects)

**Thoughts**:
At the moment I acquired a subscription with DigitalOcean, I find it interesting because with a click a LAMP type environment was created, without any further and fast. I plan to migrate from Jekyll to a blog made with Laravel in DigitalOcean.

### Day 2: December 28, 2017
##### FreeCodeCamp - Use the Twitchtv JSON API

**Today's Progress**: Finished the FCC project "Use the Twitchtv JSON API".

**Thoughts**: I really liked having used the Twitchtv API, this reinforces the use of APIs in web development. However, I have to improve the frontend part to read the webservices through AJAX and manipulate it with javascript.

**Link(s) to work**: [Using Twitchtv JSON API](https://codepen.io/eleazarbr/full/BmXreP/)

### Day 3: December 29, 2017
##### Created my personal website in Jekyll

**Today's Progress**: After reading the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) I decided to use it as the engine of my personal website.

**Thoughts**: I loved Jekyll, it's a combination of Markdown, with the Lliquid template and Ruby. For now, my website is simple but will grow with the projects I develop.

### Day 4: January 1, 2018
##### Added SSL to my website

**Today's Progress**: After holidays, finished my Jekyll personal website and added SSL.

### Day 6: January 4, 2018
##### D6 - Projects section

**Today's Progress**: Continue looking for a template for portfolio, in the future I have plans to make my own portfolio, but at this time I do not have the time to do what my mind wants.

### Day 8: January 7, 2018
##### freeCodeCamp Challenges

**Today's Progress**: Finished the challenge to convert to Roman numerals

**Thoughts**: With this algorithm I learned new features of javascript with respect to other programming languages, for example: in javascript there are no "associative arrays", so I had to address the problem in another way.

### Day 9: January 8, 2018
##### Repository Pattern

**Today's Progress**:
Today I learned about Repositories, we don't have to use it, but it is good to learn ways to better structure code.

**Thoughts**: This gives me slim easy to read controllers, and it's a nice way of extracting database logic into their own classes.

### Day 10: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I lost two days, I've been working hard coding at work, however, at home is when I can move forward and continue with my parallels projects that I'll show soon. I've done 3 challenges in freecodecamp (Wherefore art thou, Search and Replace and Pig Lating) from the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts**: I really like the following quote: "Before solving a problem in the compiler, solve it on paper". This has helped me a lot.

### Day 11: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started using Magento to develop an e-commerce project.

**Thoughts**: I've been working a lot, but I haven't had the opportunity to share it on social networks. I promise to share continuously. As I have several personal projects in mind, I work with different technologies for example, today I started reading about Magento to start developing e-commerce and established the work environment.

### Day 12: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Used the Banxico API to check the exchange rate Pesos per US dollar E.U.A. Interbank to 48 hours.

**Thoughts**: With the experience of the last projects, it's easier to consume webservices from different APIs, also, I would like to be on the other side and learn how to code an APi.

### Day 13: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to generate an iCal file that exports an event to the most common calendar systems, such as Google. I liked the [Spatie calendar-links](https://github.com/spatie/calendar-links) package. I just read the code and that is precisely what I need.

Also, I'm looking for places where I can find the best themes for Magento, I'm in another problem because I want to learn how to apply the translation to the frontend of the site in the simplest way.

Finally, I shared a laravel function that I found useful, because I needed to modify the expiration time of the password reset token to 24 hours and I needed to do tests regarding its expiration date.

**Thoughts**: Keep going with these new habits, I believe that the most important actions is to do things that are useful for others.

### Day 14: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress** Updated my personal site again and thought of a metric that has the greatest impact on my effectiveness, determining to write monthly while documenting the most important day to day.

**Thoughts** There are many things to do, must document everything and move forward, looking for ways to contribute new and useful things.
