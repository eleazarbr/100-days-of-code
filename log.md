### Day 2: December 28, 2017
##### FreeCodeCamp - Use the Twitchtv JSON API

**Today's Progress**: Finished the FCC project "Use the Twitchtv JSON API".

**Thoughts**: I really liked having used the Twitchtv API, this reinforces the use of APIs in web development. However, I have to improve the frontend part to read the webservices through AJAX and manipulate it with javascript.

### Day 3: December 29, 2017
##### Created my personal website in Jekyll

**Today's Progress**: After reading the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) I decided to use it as the engine of my personal website. 

**Thoughts**: I loved Jekyll, it's a combination of Markdown, with the Lliquid template and Ruby. For now, my website is simple but will grow with the projects I develop.

### Day 4: January 1, 2018
##### Added SSL to my website

**Today's Progress**: After holidays, finished my Jekyll personal website and added SSL.

**Thoughts**: It was not something to code, but take time to read about it and add a certificate for my site. Also added the CNAME file to use a custom domain.

##### D6 - Projects section

**Today's Progress**: Continue looking for a template for portfolio, in the future I have plans to make my own portfolio, but at this time I do not have the time to do what my mind wants.

### Day 7: January 5, 2018

### Day 8: January 7, 2018
##### freeCodeCamp Challenges

**Today's Progress**: Finished the challenge to convert to Roman numerals

**Thoughts**: With this algorithm I learned new features of javascript with respect to other programming languages, for example: in javascript there are no "associative arrays", so I had to address the problem in another way.

### Day 9: January 8, 2018
##### Repository Pattern

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I learned about Repositories, we don't have to use it, but it is good to learn ways to better structure code. 

**Thoughts**: This gives me slim easy to read controllers, and it's a nice way of extracting database logic into their own classes.
